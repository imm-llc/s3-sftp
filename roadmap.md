Need to add:

~~Widget to verify connection to S3~~

S3 upload status

Check size of file to upload and if it's larger than a certain size, warn user that it will take awhile
~~File browser~~

~~Either on install or first run, we need to create the credentials file directory~~

~~Add BUCKET_NAME Button so client can put in bucket name (?)~~
