Need to add:

~~Widget to verify connection to S3~~

S3 upload status

~~File browser~~

~~Either on install or first run, we need to create the credentials file directory~~

Add BUCKET_NAME Button so client can put in bucket name (?)
Or, alternatively, they'll only have access to one bucket so that's the only bucket they get to upload to
